# Bank Statement Consolidation (Banco General)

Recetnly had to check some insurance payments in my credit card. Currently you have to download each statement by month.
Then copy paste the part that contains the data.

I created this script to automate the copy paste part.

## How to use

Clone the repo and copy your statements to the data folder.

Run:

    python main.py

The output should be something like this
